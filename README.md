Chrome extension to "emulate" Tweetbot feed behavior.

It scrolls your feed until the last (first found) liked tweet. Sort of to try to find the point in the feed where you stopped the last time.

## Installation

- Download the repo
- Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
- Press Load unpacked
- Choose the repo folder

## Usage

- Go to your Twitter [home](https://twitter.com/home) page.
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+Y**
- See the feed scrolling

If you'd like to scroll further when the scrolling stopped, you need to add a found liked tweet to a skipped list. Press the Skip button on it. Then press **Ctrl+Shift+Y** to continue scrolling again.
